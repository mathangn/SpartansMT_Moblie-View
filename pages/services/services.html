                    have built on floor levels; some have separate buildings for different sections like that of 
                    residential apartments. Generally, it has been seen that people prefer to go for

                    bags, shoes,</b> home items, jewellery, and makeup that will make your 1 door wardrobe 
                    look beautiful. Good shopping mall should have all type of stores that includes local 
                    brands as well as international brands. The quality level of products and customer 
                    services plays an important role in building the mall's reputation and popularity among 
                    the masses. Local brand shops are often preferred by shoppers who want to shop 
                    economically, so a shopping mall is a good place for that audience to enjoy and shop 
                    as per their budget. Also, international brands always attract people for obvious 
                    reasons. Shoppers who always seek variety and quality have a lot of options at hand in 
                    this way. A huge selection of stores ensures people to shop from a wide range of 
                    products ranging from cheap to luxurious products. The more brands malls have the
